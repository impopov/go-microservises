# Microservices in Go

This is the source code for the my Udemy course **Working with Microservices and Go**. This project
consists of a number of loosely coupled microservices, all written in Go:

- broker-service: an optional single entry point to connect to all services from one place (accepts JSON;
  sends JSON, makes calls via gRPC, and pushes to RabbitMQ)
- authentication-service: authenticates users against a Postgres database (accepts JSON)
- logger-service: logs important events to a MongoDB database (accepts RPC, gRPC, and JSON)
- queue-listener-service: consumes messages from amqp (RabbitMQ) and initiates actions based on payload (sends via RPC)
- mail-service: sends email (accepts JSON)

All services (except the broker) register their access urls with etcd, and renew their leases automatically.
This allows us to implement a simple service discovery system, where all service URLs are accessible with
"service maps" in the Config type used to share application configuration in the broker service.

In addition to the microservices, the included `docker-compose.yml` at the root level of the project
starts the following services:

- Postgresql - used by the authentication service to store user accounts
- MongoDB - used by the logger service to save logs from all services
- mailhog - used as a fake mail server to work with the mail service

## Running the project
From the root level of the project, execute this command (this assumes that you have
[GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) and a recent version
of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed on your machine):

~~~
make up_build 
~~~

If the code has not changed, subsequent runs can just be `make up`.

Then start the front end:

~~~
make start
~~~

Hit the front end with your web browser at `http://localhost:80`. You can also access a web
front end to the logger service by going to `http://localhost:8082` (or whatever port you
specify in the `docker-compose.yml file`).

To stop everything:

~~~
make stop
make down
~~~
